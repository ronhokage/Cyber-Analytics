# Cyber-Analytics
## Problem- Statement:
We are trying to see the insights on the vulnerability and different cyber attacks along with their severties that exist in a cyber infrastrucrure. 
A network device was kept open i.e in the outside world and allowed different IP's to connect with it in order to understand the attacks that can exist or occur via the attacker from Source to Destination Ip.

The initial approach is to start cleaning the dataset for the important/relevant features and look into the insights by means of exploratory data analysis. Perform hypothesis testing to understand if any relation exists for one feature and another feature.

Finally, we had performed modelling to predict the severity in the network.
## Insights and Review of the usecase:
By means of these analysis we could see how atatcks are vulnerable to the organization and play a crucial role in exploting the same.
It's obvious to see exploits being the top vulnerabilty in the environment, followed by Fuzzers and Dos and by means of exploit, a hacker/attacker can find a particular vulnerability within the enivronment and can hamper the same. In additon to this, we also see exploits having the most severe or high vulnerbaility within the environment.One can also see the types of vulnerabilities that exist in the environment and how they behave time to time.

The hypothesis testing gave us an overview on how do the features play a very crucial role in decision making and determines whether any relationship exists between them or not. Tests like t-test and chi-square enabled us to decide the outcomes of the same.

The intent to find the features was in order to use them in  modelling phase and deploy the same. The final deployment would help a organization stakeholders or a CISO to check how secure the firm is when dealing with the outside vulnerabilities and the risk they possess.
The risks and vulnerabilites are ever changing and evolve contniously and hence is an important part of an organization to keep them secure from the upcoming ones.
