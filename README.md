# Cyber-Analytics
## Problem- Statement
We are trying to see the insights on the vulnerability and different cyber attacks along with their severties that exist in a cyber infrastrucrure. 
A network device was kept open i.e in the outside world and allowed different IP's to connect with it in order to understand the attacks that can exist or occur via the attacker from Source to Destination Ip.

The initial approach is to start cleaning the dataset for the important/relevant features and look into the insights by means of exploratory data analysis. Perform hypothesis testing to understand if any relation exists for one feature and another feature.

Finally, we had performed modelling to predict the severity in the network.
